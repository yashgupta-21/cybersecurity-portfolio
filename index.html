    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Raj Kumar Gupta, a highly motivated and curious individual currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in the second semester. From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been passionate about exploring the world of computers and understanding how technology shapes our lives.

Over the past few months, I’ve started taking my first serious steps into the tech industry. I recently completed a 1-month hands-on web development training, where I learned how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This training helped me build a strong foundation in front-end development and sparked my interest in how the internet works from behind the scenes. It wasn’t just about creating visually appealing websites — it was about building a digital presence and understanding how each piece of code contributes to a user’s experience.

But more than just building, I want to protect.

That’s where my true passion lies — in the exciting and ever-evolving field of Cybersecurity. I believe that in today’s connected world, security is not just a technical requirement, but a moral responsibility. As the digital world grows, so do its vulnerabilities — and I want to be someone who helps secure that world.

I'm currently learning the basics of cybersecurity and ethical hacking through self-study and practice. I’ve started exploring tools like Termux, Metasploit, Nmap, Sqlmap, and many others to get hands-on experience with reconnaissance, exploitation, and vulnerability analysis. Each day, I challenge myself to go deeper — to understand not just how attacks happen, but how to prevent them.

My short-term goals are:

To strengthen my understanding of web development and cybersecurity principles.

To create projects that demonstrate real-world applications of my skills.

To build a solid portfolio that reflects my journey and growth.

My long-term goal is:

To become a certified cybersecurity specialist, possibly earning certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) or CompTIA Security+, and work in roles that focus on protecting systems, networks, and data.

To contribute to open-source cybersecurity communities and help others who are just starting out, just like me.

Apart from technology, I believe in learning through failure, staying consistent, and always being curious. I created this website not just to showcase my work, but to tell my story — from a beginner to a future professional.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Let’s connect and grow together in this amazing field of tech and cybersecurity!
